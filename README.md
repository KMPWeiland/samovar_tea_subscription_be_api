# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...


Things we'll be looking for:
A strong understanding of Rails, React and best practices
BE: Ability to create restful routes
BE: Demonstration of well-organized code, following OOP
BE: Test Driven Development
FE: An understanding of basic usability practices and standards
FE: A clear hierarchy of information
Clear documentation
Your ability to prioritize for MVP
Clean, well factored code
Try to limit your total time to approximately 7-8 hours each side of the stack. We recommend starting with the BE, and then moving onto the FE, but you are welcome to design your own workflow. Prioritize what is important to completing MVP and demonstrating your capabilities as a developer.

Tea Subscription Service
You will create a full stack application for a Tea Subscription Service, including a Rails API and a React front end. You do NOT need to deploy this app.

Rails API
Feel free to use this starter repo with RSpec and other common gems already configured.

Requirements:
At a minimum, you must create:

- An endpoint to get all tea subscriptions
- An endpoint to get info about one subscription, including the tea(s) involved and what customer(s) is subscribed or has been in the past (if cancelled)
- An endpoint to cancel a specific subscription

Beyond the base requirements, include any additional endpoints you'd like, but be mindful of your time. You don't need to go overboard, consider what might be necessary to achieve MVP so that this API is easy to understand and consume by a Frontend Developer.

If you are looking for a stretch option, you can consume this API for tea product information: Spoontacular API

Data Details
Note: The below data outlines are meant to be a guide for data details you may use in the application. If you want to change or include more information please do so. The data below does not need to be a direct mapping to your database schema (i.e. there might be more tables involved). Keep in mind there are many ways to implement this at a database level. Just be sure to choose an option that makes sense to you and reflects how you are assuming the tea subscription service functioning. You can make business assumptions. Using fake data in your application is okay.
